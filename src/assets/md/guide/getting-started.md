# Getting Started


## Using the Angular CLI

By far the fastest way of getting started with Angular in a new
project is to use Angular's own CLI tool.

Download it by running this in your terminal or command line:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

After it's installed, change to a directory where you wish to create
your new project's folder inside. Choose a name for your project to
name the folder that will be created, say.. awesome-project:

```bash
ng new awesome-project
```

Now go grab yourself a drink while it sets up your new
`awesome-project` directory. It takes a while because it not only
creates the folder and places starter project files inside, but it
also installs all of the basic required dependencies for a
fully-fledged Angular app.

Once it's done installing, `cd awesome-project` to navigate into the
project folder, and run:

```bash
npm start
```

Ã‰t viola! You should now have an Angular app running in a development
server and available to see in your browser if you go to:
`http://localhost:4200`.


## Using a starter project

Cloning an existing "starter project" or "boilerplate" project is
always an option no matter which front-end framework you're using.

However, for those just getting started with Angular, this is not the
best approach as Angular brings with it many new concepts that haven't
previously been seen in other frameworks. Even seasoned web developers
may struggle initially with some of the concepts and using a pre-built
project could further complicate matters.

Therefore, it's highly recommended to use the official Angular CLI
tool.
