## What is Angular exactly?

Angular is the latest front-end framework from the Angular Team - who are
part of Google. Its predecessor framework, AngularJS, is still widely used
on many sites today.

### AngularJS vs Angular 2 vs Angular

It's easy to get confused when it comes to searching for Angular topics
online. This is because the original framework created by the Angular team
was called _AngularJS_, and is sometimes refered to as _Angular 1_ or even
just _Angular_. There's also the term _Angular 2_ thrown around - this is
in fact closer to what we now have as the latest version of the Angular
framework. This is in fact what the latest version of Angular used to be
known as. However, since the Angular team decided to adopt
[http://semver.org/](Semantic Versioning) to give a version number to each
release of their newest framework, the _2_ was dropped, and now it's just
known as _Angular_.

To make the distinction clearer between the older AngularJS and the newer
Angular, here's the links to their respective official documentations:

- [AngularJS (previous framework)](http://angularjs.org)
