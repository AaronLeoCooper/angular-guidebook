# Introduction

Here's a preparative introduction to prime you for what this guide is for.


## What is Angular exactly?

Angular is the latest front-end framework from the Angular Team - who are
part of Google. Its predecessor, AngularJS, is still widely used on many,
many sites of all sizes.

### AngularJS vs Angular

It's easy to get confused when it comes to searching for Angular topics
online, or simply refering to its name. This is because the original
framework created by the Angular team was called AngularJS, and is sometimes
refered to as _Angular 1_ or even just _Angular_.

To make the distinction clearer between the two and to separate the two
official documentations, here's the links to both:

[http://angular.io](Angular)
