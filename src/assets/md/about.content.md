# About This Guide


**Angular Guidebook** was created to provide an opinionated way of getting
going with the latest version of the Angular framework as quickly as
possible.

If you're completely new to Angular and need a little introduction to
it as a framework, check out the [FAQ](/faq) section.

This guide focuses on the latest version of Angular, whose official
documentation is based at [http://angular.io](http://angular.io).

If you're wishing to learn about AngularJS instead of the newer
Angular framework, a good place to start is the official documentation
for [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org).
